'''
Terminology used in trees
Root
The top node in a tree.
Child
A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root.
Parent
The converse notion of a child.
Siblings
A group of nodes with the same parent.
Descendant
A node reachable by repeated proceeding from parent to child. Also known as subchild.
Ancestor
A node reachable by repeated proceeding from child to parent.
Leaf
External node (not common)
A node with no children.
Branch node
Internal node
A node with at least one child.
Degree
For a given node, its number of children. A leaf is necessarily degree zero.
Edge
The connection between one node and another.
Path
A sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node with a descendant.
Level
The level of a node is defined as: 1 + the number of edges between the node and the root.
Height of node
The height of a node is the number of edges on the longest path between that node and a leaf.
Height of tree
The height of a tree is the height of its root node.
Depth
The depth of a node is the number of edges from the tree's root node to the node.
Forest
A forest is a set of n â‰¥ 0 disjoint trees.
